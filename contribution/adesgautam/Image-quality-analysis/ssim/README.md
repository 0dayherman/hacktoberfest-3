# SSIM(Structured Similarity and Image quality Index)Structural Similarity and Image Quality (SSIM):Natural image signals are highly “structured.” Samples taken from image signals have strong dependencies amongst themselves, and these dependencies carry important information about the structures of the objects in the visual scene. The principal idea underlying the structural similarity approach is that the HVS is highly adapted to extract structural information from visual scenes, and there- fore, a measurement of structural similarity (or distortion) should provide a good approximation to perceptual image quality.The SSIM Index is a function of two images denoted as x and y, respectively.If x is the reference/original image then the SSIM index can be regarded as the quality index of y, the distorted image.The SSIM algorithm separates the task of image similarity measurement into three comparisons: luminance, contrast, and structure.SSIM is a decimal value between (-1, 1).The image s&p_noise_0.2.jpg has SSIM value = 0.926 and the image s&p_noise_0.5.jpg has SSIM value of 0.817 comparing to the Original.jpg image.
